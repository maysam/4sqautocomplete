jQuery plugin for location autocomplete based on foursquare venue database

based on the work by <a href="http://www.josephguadagno.net/post/2012/03/19/Foursquare-Autocomplete-jQuery-Plugin.aspx">Joseph Guadagno</a>

What's new here is that the autocomplete also shows the number of people been to the place before, so gives a better notation of which option to choose when there are multiple choices available
